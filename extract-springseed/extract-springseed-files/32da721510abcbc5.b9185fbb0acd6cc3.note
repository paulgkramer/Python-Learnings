{"name":"Encryption","content":"#Concepts\n\n##Encryption\n\nTwo types of encryption keys:\n\nSymmetric: Each peer uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt (shared secret). Eg. DES, AES, 3DES\n\nAsymmetric: A peer uses one key to encrypt and another key to decrypt (public/private encryption). Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.\n\n##Authentication\n\nPre-shared keys (smaller deployments)\n\nPublic key infrastructure (PKI - larger deployments)\nCRL: Certificate Revocation List\n\n##Data Integrity\n\nHow to make sure the data has not changed since being sent\n\nMD5 - 128-bit hash\nSHA1 - 160-bit hash","notebook":"32da721510abcbc5","id":"b9185fbb0acd6cc3","date":1378982017}
