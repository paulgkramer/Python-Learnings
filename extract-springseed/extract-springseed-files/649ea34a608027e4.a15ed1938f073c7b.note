{"name":"Using Markdown","content":"Markdown is a writing format that helps you format text, in plain text. The following guide to Markdown has been taken from the [Pandoc User's Guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown).\n\nTo see the syntax in action, just click the edit button.\n\nAn h1 header\n============\n\nParagraphs are separated by a blank line.\n\n2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists\nlook like:\n\n  * this one\n  * that one\n  * the other one\n\nNote that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text\ncontent starts at 4-columns in.\n\n> Block quotes are\n> written like so.\n>\n> They can span multiple paragraphs,\n> if you like.\n\nUse 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex. \"it's all in\nchapters 12--14\"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.\n\n\n\nAn h2 header\n------------\n\nHere's a numbered list:\n\n 1. first item\n 2. second item\n 3. third item\n\nNote again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters\nfrom the left side). Here's a code sample:\n\n    # Let me re-iterate ...\n    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }\n\nAs you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of\nindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:\n\n~~~\ndefine foobar() {\n    print \"Welcome to flavor country!\";\n}\n~~~\n\n(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the\ndelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:\n\n~~~python\nimport time\n# Quick, count to ten!\nfor i in range(10):\n    # (but not *too* quick)\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    print i\n~~~\n\n\n\n### An h3 header ###\n\nNow a nested list:\n\n 1. First, get these ingredients:\n\n      * carrots\n      * celery\n      * lentils\n\n 2. Boil some water.\n\n 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow\n    this algorithm:\n\n        find wooden spoon\n        uncover pot\n        stir\n        cover pot\n        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle\n        wait 10 minutes\n        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)\n\n    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.\n\nNotice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including\nthat last line which continues item 3 above). Here's a link to [a\nwebsite](http://foo.bar). Here's a link to a [local\ndoc](local-doc.html). Here's a footnote [^1].\n\n[^1]: Footnote text goes here.","notebook":"649ea34a608027e4","id":"a15ed1938f073c7b","date":1380448232}
