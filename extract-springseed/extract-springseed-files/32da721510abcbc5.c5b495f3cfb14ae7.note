{"name":"OSPF","content":"#Concepts\n\nHellos: Timers, Area, Authentication, Subnet mask must match\n\nTimers: \n\nHello = 10 seconds\nDead = 40 seconds\n\n##Areas: \n\nA point of summarisation. Good for international WAN links.\n\nUses:\n1. Sumarisation\n2. Fault containment\n\n###Area Border Routers\n    *Autonomous System Doundary Router (ASBR)\n        *Can be interconnected with other routing protocols\n    *All areas must be connected directly to the main area (area 0)\n\n\n##Metric \n\nCost = 100 / BW-in-Mbps\n\n* 56k = 1785\n* 64k = 1562\n* T1 (1.544) = 64\n* E1 (2.048) = 48\n* Ethernet = 10\n* Fast Ethernet = 1\n\n    - auto cost reference bandwidth <number>: will replace the 100 in metric calculation\n\n\n\n##Neighbor Relationships\n\n1. Determine Router ID - Highest active interface IP address when OSPF starts (loopbacks beat physical interfaces)\n\n2. Add interfaces to the link state database\n\n3. Send a hello message on chosen interfaces\n    *Router ID\n    *Area ID\n    *Authentication password\n    *Network Mask\n    *Hello and dead timers\n\n4. Receive Hello and check all above charateristics\n\n5. Send reply hello\n    *Am I listed as a nieghbor in your hello packet? If yes, reset dead timer. If no, add as new neighbor. (dead timer will always bounce between 40 and 30 seconds)\n\n6. Master/Slave relationship determined\n    *Determined by \"priority\", router-id breaks tie\n    *Master sends database description (DBD) packet. DBD = cliff notes of link-state database\n    *clave sends it DBD packet\n\n7. DBDs are acknowledged and reviewed\n    *Slave requests details (Link state requests - LSR)\n    *Master sends updates (Link state updates - LSU)\n    *Master Requests details (LSR)\n    *Slave sends updates (LSU)\n\n8. Neighbors are synchronised.    \n\n    *routers start in DOWN state, move to INIT, then to 2WAY, then EXSTART, then EXCHANGE (DBD exchange), LOADING (loading requests and updates), FULL\n\nTime to run the Dijkstra SPF algorithm to figure out what to do with link state information.\n\n\n\n#Configuration\n\n    #router ospf 1\n    #network 192.168.2.1 0.0.0.0 area 0\npassive-interface fa0/0 (stops sending hellos out of an interface)\n\n    #show ip ospf neighbor\n    #show ip route\n    #show ip protocols\n    #debug ip ospf packet\n\n\nThe network command does two things:\n\n1.Identifies what interfaces to send hallo packets on\n2. Identifies what networks to advertise (looks at the IP and subnet configured on the interface and advertises that subnet)\n\n\n\n\n\n","notebook":"32da721510abcbc5","id":"c5b495f3cfb14ae7","date":1382507548}
