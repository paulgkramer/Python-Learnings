{"name":"PVST+ and RSTP","content":"#Concept\n\nSTP\n\n1. Listening \n\n    * 15 second of listening for BPDUs\n    * switch sends / receives BPDUs\n\n2. Learning\n\n    * 15 seconds of learning MAC accdresses\n    * Populates switch CAM table\n\n3. Forwarding\n\n    * Port is forwarding traffic\n\n4. Blocking\n\n    * Switch will wait up to 20 seconds (max-age) before moving a blocked port into listening phase.\n\n \n**50 seconds Total**\n\n##Port Fast\n\n* Disables spanning tree\n* Designed for single devices (i.e. PC)\n\n##PVST+\n\n* Runs an instance of STP per-VLAN\n* Allows different root bridges per-VLAN\n* Allows load balancing of traffic over STP switches\n\n\n##Rapid STP\n\n* 3 Statuses: Discarding, learning, forwarding\n\n* 802.1w - enhances 802.1d STP\n\n* More logical port types\n    * Root port - used to reach the root bridge\n    * Designated port - forwarding port, one per link\n    * Alternate port - discarding port, backup path to root\n\n* Exactly the same result but without the timers\n* BPDU is sent from new link BUT the link is blocked immediately. The link is only made active when an acknowledgement is received from the switch connected to the DP.\n","notebook":"32da721510abcbc5","id":"e09b509580de4a23","date":1382234966}
