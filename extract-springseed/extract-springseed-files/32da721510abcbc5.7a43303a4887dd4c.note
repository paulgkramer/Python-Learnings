{"name":"HSRP, VRRP, GLBP","content":"#Concepts\n\n##Cisco Hot-Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)\n\nHighest priority (higher IP address is the tie breaker) = Active Router\n\nBy Default: No Premption - if a standby takes over and then the previous active comes back online, the standby will stay enabled.\n\n###Hello - 3 seconds; Hold - 10 seconds\n\n* gateways organised into standby groups\n* one gateway active, others in standby state\n* phantom (virtual) router IP and MAC address generated\n* hello messages send one every 3 seconds; dead after 1- seconds\n* Virtual IP does not need to be on same subnet as physical interfaces\n* The MAC address 00-00-0c-07-ac-xx is reserved for HSRP\n\n##Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol\n\n###Hello - 1 second; Hold - 3 seconds\n\n* Routers physical IP address can double as the virtual IP address in a group\n\n##Gateway Load Balancing Protocol\n\n###Hello - 3 seconds; Hold - 10 seconds\n\nIdentical to HSRP, but allows active - active load-balancing\n\n* Virtual IP address can be the same as a routers physical IP address\n* One gateway assigned active virtual gateway role (AVG)\n* AVG - Resonsible for responding to ARP requests\n* SUpports up to 1024 virtual routers\n* support cleartext and MD5 password authentication between GLBP group members\n* Can load share across a maximum four routers\n \n\n#Configuration\n\nCBT Nuggets HSRP Lab\n\n    #show standby\n        \n    #glbp 1 ip 10.1.1.1 (for GLBP)\n    \n    #standby 1 ip 192.168.1.1\n    #standby 1 priority 115\n    #standby 1 preempt delay 300 (stops flapping)\n    #standby 1 authentication md5 key-string <word>\n    #standby 1 timers msec\n    #standby 1 track (decrements priority when router goes down - preempt must be configured)\n\n\n\n##Stanleys Notes\n\nEach Protocol use Virtual Default gateway’s and Virtual MAC addresses in redundant Links.\n \nHSRP (Hot-Standby Router Protocol)\n* Created by Cisco, for Cisco in 1994\n* Hello message every 3 seconds, Hold message every 10 seconds.\n•\tGateways are Organized into standby Groups\n•\tOne Active Gateway, Others in a Standby State \n•\tThe active Router is chosen using Priority Values, Higher Priority number becomes the Active Gateway\n•\tPhantom (Virtual) Router IP and MAC address are Generated\n \nVRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)\n•\tCreated by the IETF in 1999\n•\tHello message every 1 second, Hold message every 3 seconds.\n \nGLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)\n•\tCreated by Cisco, For Cisco in 2005\n•\tIdentical to HSRP, But allows active-active Load-Balancing\n•\tOne Gateway assigned as the Active Virtual Gateway (AVG) role\n•\tAdditional Gateways act as active virtual forwarders (AVF)\n•\tPhantom (Virtual) Router IP and MAC address are Generated. \n•\tVirtual MAC addresses are generated for every AVF\n•\tAVG Responds to ARP requests, Load balances MAC address replies\n•\tLoad balancing - ARP request from PC1 will return the MAC address from AVG, ARP request from PC2 will return the MAC Address of the first AVF and so on.\n","notebook":"32da721510abcbc5","id":"7a43303a4887dd4c","date":1382441468}
