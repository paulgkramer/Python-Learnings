Full routing table update at convergence\n\t2. Successor and feasible successor = saves time if successor route goes down. The router will look into its topology table for feasible sucessor\n\t3. Can load balance if two routes to destination and one metric is higher than another (unequal cost load balancing. Command=variance)\n\n\n###Disadvantages:\n\t1.
