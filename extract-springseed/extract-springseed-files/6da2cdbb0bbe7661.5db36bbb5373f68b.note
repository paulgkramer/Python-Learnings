One one VLAN can be tagged.\n\ncreate vlan vlan1\n\nconfigure vlan vlan1 ipaddress 10.0.0.1/24 <--- Subnet at end of /\n\nconfigure vlan vlan1 tag 1001\n\nconfigure vlan vlan1 add ports 1-10 <--- I am assuming untagged her\n\ncreate vlan vlan2 \n\nconfigure vlan vlan2 ipaddress 20.0.0.1/24\n\nconfigure vlan vlan2 tag 2001 \n\nconfigure vlan vlan2 add ports 11-20\n\nI noticed that you will be adding port 10 to both vlans, I am guessing that this is a typo or you will need to have one of the VLANs be tagged.\n\nFor the uplink port\n\nconfigure vlan vlan1 add port 24 tagged\n\nconfigure vlan vlan2 add port 24 tagged\n\nThe connection on the other end of your uplink port will need to understand 802.1Q and VLAN tags will need to match.
