Welcome to Ethernation.

First, I have to understand if you are tagging both VLANs. One one VLAN can be tagged.

create vlan vlan1

configure vlan vlan1 ipaddress 10.0.0.1/24 <--- Subnet at end of /

configure vlan vlan1 tag 1001

configure vlan vlan1 add ports 1-10 <--- I am assuming untagged her

create vlan vlan2 

configure vlan vlan2 ipaddress 20.0.0.1/24

configure vlan vlan2 tag 2001 

configure vlan vlan2 add ports 11-20

I noticed that you will be adding port 10 to both vlans, I am guessing that this is a typo or you will need to have one of the VLANs be tagged.

For the uplink port

configure vlan vlan1 add port 24 tagged

configure vlan vlan2 add port 24 tagged

The connection on the other end of your uplink port will need to understand 802.1Q and VLAN tags will need to match. For more on 801.1Q see:
