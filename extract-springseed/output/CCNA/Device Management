#Concepts

##The IOS Boot Process
1. Check the configuration register
2. Check for "boot system" commands in startup commands
3. Look for first IOS image in flash
4. Broadcast for a TFTP server
5. Boot to ROMMON

###Configuration Register
* 2100: ROMMON - Bad flash IOS or flash memory issue
* 2102: Boot Normally
* 2101: RXBOOT
* 2142: Ignore NVRAM - password recovery ("copy start run" and then change passwords)


##Understanding File Storage Locations

Flash: IOS
RAM: IOS copied from Flash after bootup
NVRAM: startup-config

**Copy into RAM will do a merge of configurations**
