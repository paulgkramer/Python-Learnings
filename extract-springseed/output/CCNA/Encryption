#Concepts

##Encryption

Two types of encryption keys:

Symmetric: Each peer uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt (shared secret). Eg. DES, AES, 3DES

Asymmetric: A peer uses one key to encrypt and another key to decrypt (public/private encryption). Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.

##Authentication

Pre-shared keys (smaller deployments)

Public key infrastructure (PKI - larger deployments)
CRL: Certificate Revocation List

##Data Integrity

How to make sure the data has not changed since being sent

MD5 - 128-bit hash
SHA1 - 160-bit hash
