A list of permit and deny statements 

- permit 192.168.2.50
- deny 192.168.1.0/24
- permit TCP port 80 for 200.1.1.1


* Invisable implicit deny at the bottom of each list
* traffic flows freely through routers until an access list is applied

##Standard

* Matches based only on source address
* lower processor utilisation
* affect depends on application (i.e. VOIP with QoS) 

###"Unreachable" in a ping command usually means blocked

###* Apply as close to the destination as possible to avoid falsee positives because the net is so wide (source IP address)

##Extended

* Matches based on source/destination address, protocol, source/destination port number

* Higher processor utilisation

* Syntax takees some time to learn

###Apply as close to the source as possible to save on wasted bandwidth

###ALWAYS remember to permit all other traffic if router is in between networks


##Reflexive (established)

* allows return traffic for internal requests

#Configuration

## Standard Numbered Access Lists
    #access-list 1 permit all
    #access-list 1 deny host 10.1.1.1
    #ip access-group 1 in

##Standard Named Access Lists
    #ip access-list standard BLOCK_PC2_ACL
    #deny 192.168.2.50 0.0.0.0
    #permit any

**"ip access-list" allows named access lists


## Numbered Extended Access-Lists

    # access-list 100 deny ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.128 0.0.0.127
    # access-list 100 permit ip any any

    # ip access-list extended 100
    # 11 deny tcp 192.168.1.50  0.0.0.0 192.168.2.50 0.0.0.0 eq 80
    # 12 deny tcp 192.168.1.50  0.0.0.0 192.168.2.50 0.0.0.0 eq 443

*Question 236.*

    #access-list 100 permit tcp host 192.168.33.3 host 172.22.242.23 eq 80
    #access-list 100 deny tcp any host 172.22.242.23 eq 80
    #access-list 100 permit ip any any
