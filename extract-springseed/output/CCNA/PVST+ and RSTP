#Concept

STP

1. Listening 

    * 15 second of listening for BPDUs
    * switch sends / receives BPDUs

2. Learning

    * 15 seconds of learning MAC accdresses
    * Populates switch CAM table

3. Forwarding

    * Port is forwarding traffic

4. Blocking

    * Switch will wait up to 20 seconds (max-age) before moving a blocked port into listening phase.

 
**50 seconds Total**

##Port Fast

* Disables spanning tree
* Designed for single devices (i.e. PC)

##PVST+

* Runs an instance of STP per-VLAN
* Allows different root bridges per-VLAN
* Allows load balancing of traffic over STP switches


##Rapid STP

* 3 Statuses: Discarding, learning, forwarding

* 802.1w - enhances 802.1d STP

* More logical port types
    * Root port - used to reach the root bridge
    * Designated port - forwarding port, one per link
    * Alternate port - discarding port, backup path to root

* Exactly the same result but without the timers
* BPDU is sent from new link BUT the link is blocked immediately. The link is only made active when an acknowledgement is received from the switch connected to the DP.
