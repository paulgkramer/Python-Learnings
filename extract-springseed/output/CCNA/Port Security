#Concept

Number of MAC addresses per port

What MAC address is on a port

-Can react in shutdown (err-disable), protect, restrict mode

1. Protect - Will ignore the offending device, but there are no logged messages
2. Restrict - counters are increased and a log entry is made
3. Shutdown - shuts down the interface

-default commands do not display in the running config

#Configuration

Default: # switchport mode dynamic desirable - can be either an access or a trunk but stresses a trunk

Recommended: 
    # switchport mode access
    # switchport port-security maximum 1(how many mac addresses at a time on a port)
    # switchport port-security violation shutdown
    #switchport port-security mac-address 0000:0000:0000
    #switchport port-security mac-address sticky (takes the first mac address and allows only it to use the port if maximum is set to 1)
    #switchport port security
    #show port-security

Must shutdown a port after a violation condition has been met to get port back online
