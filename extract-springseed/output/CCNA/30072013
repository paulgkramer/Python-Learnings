##Troubleshooting OSPF

Hellos sent to 224.0.0.5

\#debug ip ospf hello


Hello timers should be the same on both routers

\# ip ospf hello-interval 5

In routing table: [100/43125]

Admin distance = 100
Cost = 43125

###To calculate cost: 
(10 ^ 8)/bandwidth(bps)
100/bandwidth(MBPS)

###To change 10 or 100 to 1000

\#auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000

*this will support gigabit interfaces and should be the same across all routers

###To turn off Hellos from a router interface:
    #router ospf 1
    #passive-interface s/0/0/0


###To force a cost value on a particular interface:

Router ospf 1
Int s0/0/0
Bandwidth


##IPV6 and OSPFv3

    #Ipv6 unicast-routing

Router ID is same as IPv4
MUST have an IPv4 interface to automatically create router-id

    # int s0/0/0
    (config-if)# Ipv6 ospf 1 area 0



##EIGRP
	
	- Cisco proprietry
	- Hellos sent on 224.0.0.10
		â Consists of AS no., subnet, authentication (if used)
	- If neighbor relationship is created, topology table (database) is shared
	- From topology table, routing table is created
	- Dual: Diffusing update algorithm used to calculate lowest metric
	- Calcuate metric on:
		â Delay and bandwidth (load, reliability optional)
	- Metric= ((10^7/least bandwidth) + cumulative delay) * 256
	- Is classless and classful (command for classless: no auto summary
	- "#router eigrp 1" where 1 = 1 autonomous system number and is required for neighbor relationship
	- sucessesor route = lowest metric
	- Feasible successor = second lowest metric

###Troubleshooting

\#debug eigrp packets
\#show ip protocol
\#show ip eigrp neighbor
\#show ip eigrp topology
\#show ip router
\#show ip eigrp interface

###Advantages:
	1. Full routing table update at convergence
	2. Successor and feasible successor = saves time if successor route goes down. The router will look into its topology table for feasible sucessor
	3. Can load balance if two routes to destination and one metric is higher than another (unequal cost load balancing. Command=variance)


###Disadvantages:
	1. Uses high amount of router resources

	

##IPV6 for EIGRP
	
	\#Ipv6 unicast-routing
	\#ipv6 router eigrp 1
	\#no shutdown
	
	\#int s0/0/0
	\#ipv6 eigrp 1
	\#ipv6 autentication mode eigrp md5
	\#ipv6 authentication key-chain eigrp 1 <keychain name>


##WANs

DTE = customer side of NTU
DCE = ISP side of NTU (provides clocking)

###PPP - PAP

	1. #ppp authentication
	2. Username and password on both side routers

###CHAP

	1. Username different on both routers
	2. Password must be the same
	3. Far routers responds with a challenge (ie. #017817) and a original sending router username
	4. Melbourne router receive challenge and sends back challenge and password encrypted as MD5
	5. Password cannot be reverse engineered, hence password is never send across WAN
	
\#debug ppp authentication

"\#u all" stops all debugging


"\#sh run | in username" searches name in the running config
