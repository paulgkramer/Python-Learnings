##Simplistic View: All switches find the best way to reach the root bridge (the centre of the network) then block all redundant links

Switches send BPDUs with its bridge ID eg. 32768.111.111.111
= Bridge priority.Mac Address

32768 = Default priorty
0-65535 possible values

### Root switch is one with the lowest bridge ID

* Root Port: Port on the switch to reach root bridge
* Designated Port: forwarding port, one per link

Root bridge will never have a root port - all will be designated ports 

1. Elect the Root
*BPDUs are sent around the network

2. Find the best path to the root

3. Block whatever is left over

**Lowest Cost**

    *Link Bandwidth         Cost
    *10Mbps         =         100
    *100Mbps        =        19
    *1Gbps            =        4
    *10Gbps           =        2

*Lowest bridge ID

*Lowest port number

*Enable one designated port per link
