##Cisco Hot-Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)

Highest priority (higher IP address is the tie breaker) = Active Router

By Default: No Premption - if a standby takes over and then the previous active comes back online, the standby will stay enabled.

###Hello - 3 seconds; Hold - 10 seconds

* gateways organised into standby groups
* one gateway active, others in standby state
* phantom (virtual) router IP and MAC address generated
* hello messages send one every 3 seconds; dead after 1- seconds
* Virtual IP does not need to be on same subnet as physical interfaces
* The MAC address 00-00-0c-07-ac-xx is reserved for HSRP

##Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol

###Hello - 1 second; Hold - 3 seconds

* Routers physical IP address can double as the virtual IP address in a group

##Gateway Load Balancing Protocol

###Hello - 3 seconds; Hold - 10 seconds

Identical to HSRP, but allows active - active load-balancing

* Virtual IP address can be the same as a routers physical IP address
* One gateway assigned active virtual gateway role (AVG)
* AVG - Resonsible for responding to ARP requests
* SUpports up to 1024 virtual routers
* support cleartext and MD5 password authentication between GLBP group members
* Can load share across a maximum four routers
 

#Configuration

CBT Nuggets HSRP Lab

    #show standby
        
    #glbp 1 ip 10.1.1.1 (for GLBP)
    
    #standby 1 ip 192.168.1.1
    #standby 1 priority 115
    #standby 1 preempt delay 300 (stops flapping)
    #standby 1 authentication md5 key-string <word>
    #standby 1 timers msec
    #standby 1 track (decrements priority when router goes down - preempt must be configured)



##Stanleys Notes

Each Protocol use Virtual Default gateway’s and Virtual MAC addresses in redundant Links.
 
HSRP (Hot-Standby Router Protocol)
* Created by Cisco, for Cisco in 1994
* Hello message every 3 seconds, Hold message every 10 seconds.
•	Gateways are Organized into standby Groups
•	One Active Gateway, Others in a Standby State 
•	The active Router is chosen using Priority Values, Higher Priority number becomes the Active Gateway
•	Phantom (Virtual) Router IP and MAC address are Generated
 
VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
•	Created by the IETF in 1999
•	Hello message every 1 second, Hold message every 3 seconds.
 
GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)
•	Created by Cisco, For Cisco in 2005
•	Identical to HSRP, But allows active-active Load-Balancing
•	One Gateway assigned as the Active Virtual Gateway (AVG) role
•	Additional Gateways act as active virtual forwarders (AVF)
•	Phantom (Virtual) Router IP and MAC address are Generated. 
•	Virtual MAC addresses are generated for every AVF
•	AVG Responds to ARP requests, Load balances MAC address replies
•	Load balancing - ARP request from PC1 will return the MAC address from AVG, ARP request from PC2 will return the MAC Address of the first AVF and so on.
