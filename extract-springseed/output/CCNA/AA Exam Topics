CCNA Composite Exam: The 200-120 CCNAX is the composite exam associated with the Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching certification. Candidates can prepare for this exam by taking the Interconnecting Cisco Networking Devices:  Accelerated (CCNAX) course. This exam tests a candidate's knowledge and skills required to install, operate, and troubleshoot a small to medium size enterprise branch network. The topics include all the areas covered under ICND 1 and ICND2 Exams.
 
The following topics are general guidelines for the content likely to be included on the Cisco Certified Network Associate exam.
