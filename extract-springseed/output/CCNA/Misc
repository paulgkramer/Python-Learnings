* The destination IP address 10.1.5.65 belongs to 10.1.5.64/28, 10.1.5.64/29 & 10.1.5.64/27
subnets but the “longest prefix match” algorithm will choose **the most specific subnet mask** -> the
prefix “/29 will be chosen to route the packet. Therefore the next-hop should be 10.1.3.3 -> 


* 4 equal cost paths alowed in OSPF
