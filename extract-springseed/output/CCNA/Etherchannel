#Concept

* Only between directly connected switches
* Must have identical base configuration 
* Up to 8 connections
* channel groups dont need to match on both sides

* Packet will not be split up for load balancing. I.e. 4 * 100 MB/s links in Etherchannel. a 100MB file will only use one of the Etherchannel links

* 2, 4 or 8 links

##PAgP

* Cisco Proprietary
* Modes: on, desirable, auto

Desirable: Agressive in negotiating with far end
Auto: Will not actively establish a connection. Will accept a new connection from a far end desirable setup.

##LACP

* Industry Standard
* Modes: on, active, passive 


#Configuration

    #int range fastethernet 0/1-2
    #channel-group 10 mode {active|auto|desirable|on|passive}
