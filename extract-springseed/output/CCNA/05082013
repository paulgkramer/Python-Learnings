#Frame Relay

- A shared WAN technology (PPP and HDLC are dedicated)

## IPSEC Key types

1. Asymetric: RSA, Diffie Hellman

Min = 512 bits
max = 4096 bits

2. Symertric: DES, 3DES, AES

Min = 56 bits
max = 256 bits

Keepalive messages between DTE and DCE are called local management interface

PVC = perminent virtual circuit

##Feking Bacon:

###FECN: Forward Explicit Congestion Notification

Tells the remote side to slow down transfer rate. Comes from a frame relay switch in the ISP cloud.

###BECN: Backwards Explicit Congestion Notification

Return message 

###DE = Discard Eligibility

Data being send that's more than the CiR. Type of QoS

## Inverse ARP

IP to DLCI

##Full Mesh Frame relay

*Advantage*: all interfaces can be in the same subnet

Partial Mesh Frame relay
**advantage:** Can use subinterface (s0/0.1) to save on used interfaces
**disadvantage:** all interfaces must be on diefferent subnet

FR = NBMA (Non broadcast mutli access)
Otherwise OSPF multicasts to other routers on customer network will not arrive (224.0.0.5)


"show frame-relay map" - to show all DLCIs on a switch

**Learn how to configure ADSL on Cisco routers**

Remember PPP over Ethernet - MTU must be 1492. PPP header is 8 bits


#First Hop Redundancy

###HSRP

**Hot Standby Router Protocol

Group Number = 1

standby 1 ip <virtual IP>

- Active router becomes the higher IP address on an HSRP interface
- Virtual MAC address is defined: First 6 Cisco MAC ID, first hop redundancy, Last 2 digits group number 0000.0C


###VRRP

** Virtual Router Redundancy

IETF




###GLBP

** Gateway Load Balancing Protocol

Cisco Proprietry 


##Logs

**Syslog

\#logging trap 0-7

UDP Port 514

No Encryption

**SNMP

Manager, Agent, Database

v1, 
v2, 2C,
v3 - Can configure encryption with hashed passwords


##Netflow

Int fa0/1
ip flow ingress
ip flow egress
exit

ip flow-export destination 10.1.10.100 99
ip flow-export version 9
ip flow-export source loopback 0
end

/#show version = flash:version of IOS that's running, model no.

##Licensing

IP base = Free

/#show license udi = unique serial number of device
/#show license
/#show license feature

license boot module c2900 technology-package secuirty k9
=60 trial of feature

##IPV6 vs IPV4 Summary

-8 quartets
-4 Hex values

Can remove leading zeroes and replace with one 0

fe80:0000:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:0001
Fe80:0:0:1:0:0:0:1
fe80:0:0:0:1::1

##IPV4: 

Unicast, Multicast, Broadcast = 3 types of addresses

Unicast: Public, Private (172.16-31x.x, Loopback, aPIPA (169.234.x.x)

##IPV6:

Unicast, multicast, anycast: 

Public: ISP global unicast

Private: site local, unique local FD00::/8 , 

Loopback (::1)

Multicast, Anycast = 3 types of addresses
