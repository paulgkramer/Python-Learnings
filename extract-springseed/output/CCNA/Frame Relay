#Concepts

PVC - Perminent Virtual Circuit

DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier: used for layer 2 addressing (AKA. MAC addresses) and are locally significant (i.e. there can be replicated DLCIs - source DLCI is wiped once packet hits the ISP cloud). Addressing is typically flipped from source to destination.

CIR - Commited information rate: Minimum amount of bandwidth on a link

LAR - Local Access Rate: Maximum amount of bandwidth on a link

LMI - Local Management Interface: Signalling between customer router and ISP which used to deliver list of DLCIs (Cisco, ANSI, Q.933A)

DE - Discard Eligible: Bandwidth which is reclaimed by the ISP which is above the CIR of a connection

###3 Types of Frame Relay network

Partial Mesh

Full Mesh

Hub and Spoke

##Multipoint Design

- Where all routers are on the same subnet
- Causes problems with Split Horizon (Never tell somebody something they told you). Theres only one interface for each router to the frame relay network so routing changes arn't published to any of the far end routers. In this case. it's best to disable split horizon

##Point-To-Point Design

- A different subnet for each router at each site
- Sub-interfaces dedicated to each link to spoke routers on hub router 

#Configuration

    #encapsulation frame-relay
    #show frame-relay pvc

##PVC Status:
1. Inactive - Link is up but something is wrong with the other side
2. Active
3. Deleted - the DLCI doesnt exist in the ISP
