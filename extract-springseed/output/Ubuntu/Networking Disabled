If you cannot connect to the Internet (wired/wireless connection) because the network manager applet is no longer showing in the top panel of Ubuntu 13.04/12.10, you can try the solution given below which may solve your problem.

Getting Started

Open the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and stop the network manager process if it is still running in the background with this command:

sudo service network-manager stop

Now remove this file using the following command:

sudo rm /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state

Start the network manager now with this command:

sudo service network-manager start

The network manager icon will appear again in the top panel of Ubuntu Unity.
